# Anagrams-Solver

<h2>Overview</h2>
Given the input of 3-9 letters, the project displays all the possible words in the Mateus' Anagrams Dictionary that can be made using the following letters

<h2>Oxford English Dictionary</h2>

Got this textfile online <a href ="https://github.com/sujithps/Dictionary/blob/master/Oxford%20English%20Dictionary.txt">here</a>
Using the original oxford dictionary text file, I cleansed and filtered the data into a new text file that would be more accessible for the purposes of the project

<h2>Mateus' Anagrams Dictionary</h2>
The result of me cleaning and transforming the data from the Oxford English Dictionary File. Here I removed the definitions of all the words as well as removed duplicates of words. For the sake of my project, I was only interested in words that contained 3 to 9 characters so this file filtered out all other words bigger or smaller than that.
